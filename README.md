# Convert .stl into .json as a polygonal mesh data

This small project was created to easify 3D object creation in some other software.

Its easily rebuilds surfaces while removing triangulation.

## Features:
- Extract vertices/edges from a given ".STL" file surfaces;
- Export data into json;
- Fast drag-n-drop action.

## Use:

The exported json data then can be used later to rebuild things. 

Right here we used the data to rebuild the car mesh in a **Storybrew editor**:
