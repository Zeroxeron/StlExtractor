# Convert .stl into .json as a mesh data

This small project was created to easify 3D object creation in some other software.

## Features:
- Extract vertices/edges from a given ".STL" file.
- Export data into json.
- Fast convert via drag-n-drop.

The exported json data then can be used later to rebuild things.
